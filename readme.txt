DND Shop notes: ideas, formatting, making a functional front-end

*fake storefront for magic items, sorted by campaign.
    *individual item squares like Steam w/price that show a closer look on hover (desc + image cycle)
        *on click, leads to a "purchase page" that shows: Text Description, Grid Range,
            Image of Item, price,

*drop-down menus at the top for different campaigns/cities? followed by sections for weapons, armor, etc.

*fake company about at the bottom

css notes:
*use a flexbox with buttons + jscript to toggle "Hidden" for headers/tabs of shops
*use grid of div/buttons(?) for items, which reveal a box with info on hover
*

@media goes anywher, after overwrite
